# Phase <N>: <Title>

## 1. Objective

## 2. Relation to project end-state

## 3. Entry criteria and inherited evidence

## 4. Scope

## 5. Non-goals

## 6. Current-state audit

## 7. Assumptions, constraints, risks, and decisions

## 8. Dependencies

## 9. Architecture and affected systems

## 10. Files and paths in scope

## 11. Supporting documents to create or update

## 12. Ordered implementation tasks

For each task include:

- objective
- dependencies
- exact files/systems
- implementation notes
- validation evidence
- completion state

## 13. Sub-agent delegation map

## 14. Test and validation matrix

| Requirement | Validation method | Expected evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

## 15. Security, privacy, reliability, accessibility, and performance checks

## 16. Environment-variable registry

Never include values.

| Variable name | Purpose | Scope/environment | Required by phase | Source/provider | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## 17. Deferred human-action queue

Record actions but do not request them unless they are strict blockers.

| Action | Why agent cannot perform it | Earliest required phase | Blocking now? | Final-checklist destination |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## 18. Rollback and recovery

## 19. Acceptance criteria

## 20. Completion evidence

## 21. Deviations and follow-ups

## 22. Next Plan Generation Prompt

Read `/AGENTS.md`, the complete core agent context, `/instructions/PROJECT_PLANNING.md`, the original `docs/plans/phase_0_foundations_plan.md`, this completed phase plan, all completion evidence, current repository state, active blockers, and relevant decisions. Confirm this phase is fully implemented and validated. Then generate exactly one exhaustive next phase plan at `docs/plans/phase_<NEXT_NUMBER>_<DESCRIPTIVE_SLUG>_plan.md`. Derive it from the phase-0 roadmap and verified current state, preserve unresolved requirements, include all required plan sections, defer non-blocking human actions to the final phase, and do not implement the next phase until the plan is written.
